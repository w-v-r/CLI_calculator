# C++ Calculator: Lessons Learned

## 1. Basic Program Structure
Every C++ program requires certain fundamental elements:

## 2. Variables and Data Types
C++ is a statically-typed language, meaning we must declare variable types:

## 3. Input/Output Operations
C++ uses iostream for console input/output:

## 4. Control Flow
Program flow is controlled using conditional statements:

## 5. Error Handling
Basic error checking prevents program crashes:

## 6. String Concatenation
Combining text and variables in output:

## 7. Code Organization
Good practices for writing maintainable code:

## 8. Operators
Common operators in C++:
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`
- Assignment: `=`
- Stream: `<<`, `>>`

## Next Steps
To enhance this calculator, consider:
1. Adding a loop to perform multiple calculations
2. Implementing more complex operations (power, square root)
3. Adding input validation
4. Supporting parentheses in expressions
5. Adding memory functions (like a real calculator)
