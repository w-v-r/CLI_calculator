Build a small CLI calculator using C++

## What We're Building

We're creating a command-line calculator that can:
1. Take mathematical expressions as input
2. Support basic operations (+, -, *, /)
3. Process one calculation at a time
4. Run continuously until the user chooses to exit

## Learning Goals

By building this calculator, you'll learn:
- Basic C++ syntax and program structure
- How to handle user input and output
- String parsing and manipulation
- Basic error handling
- Program flow control
- Working with functions and operators

## Project Structure

The project will be built in stages:
1. Basic program setup and user input
2. Parsing expressions into numbers and operators
3. Performing calculations
4. Adding error handling
5. Creating a continuous loop with exit option

## Getting Started

To begin, you'll need:
- A C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- A text editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of command line usage

## Building and Running
